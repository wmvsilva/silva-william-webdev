# silva-william-webdev

### About me

My name is William Silva, and I am a student at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science. I am in the combined BS and MS program and will be graduating at the end of Fall 2017 with both degrees.

I've completed three software development co-ops  at Galatea Associates, Swoop, and SmarterTravel. At SmarterTravel, I did my first web development work using React to make travel search websites like[this](http://www.bookingbuddy.com/en/topdeals/). Currently, I'm focusing on classes rather than working on any personal projects.

### Purpose of Repo

This repository was created for `CS 5610 Web Development` which I am currently taking in the Summer 2 2017 session. This repository will contain the assignments for this class as well as the project. The instructor and TAs have been added as collaborators so they can grade my work.
